- **RULE 1**: A/an agrees with its noun in the singular only
- **RULE 2**: The belongs to nouns to limit/define their meaning
- **RULE 3**: The nominative case governs the verb
- **RULE 4**: The verb must agree with its nominative in number and person
- **RULE 5**: Nominative independent case for addressed nouns/pronouns
- **RULE 6**: Nominative absolute case for nouns/pronouns before participles
- **RULE 7**: Apposition - nouns/pronouns signifying the same thing are in the same case
- **RULE 8**: Compound subjects need plural verb/pronoun
- **RULE 9**: Singular agreement for subjects connected by disjunctive conjunctions
- **RULE 10**: Singular agreement for collective nouns conveying unity
- **RULE 11**: Plural agreement for nouns of multitude conveying plurality
- **RULE 12**: A noun or pronoun in the possessive case is governed by the noun which it possesses
- **RULE 13**: Personal pronouns agree with their nouns in gender and number
- **RULE 14**: Relative pronouns agree with their antecedents
- **RULE 15**: Relative pronoun is nominative when no nominative comes between it and the verb
- **RULE 16**: Relative pronoun is governed by the following verb when a nominative comes between them
- **RULE 17**: Interrogative pronouns agree with their subsequent in case
- **RULE 18**: Adjectives belong to, and qualify, nouns expressed or understood
- **RULE 19**: Adjective pronouns belong to nouns
- **RULE 20**: Active-transitive verbs govern the objective case
- **RULE 21**: To be admits the same case after it as before it
- **RULE 22**: Active-intransitive, passive, and neuter verbs have the same case before and after them
- **RULE 23**: Infinitive mood verb is governed by a verb, noun, adjective, participle, or pronoun
- **RULE 24**: Infinitive mood is used as the nominative case to a verb or the object of an active-transitive verb
- **RULE 25**: Bare infinitive after certain verbs
- **RULE 26**: Participles have the same government as the verbs from which they are derived
- **RULE 27**: Present participle refers to some noun or pronoun denoting the subject or actor
- **RULE 28**: Perfect participle belongs, like an adjective, to some noun or pronoun
- **RULE 29**: Adverbs qualify verbs, participles, adjectives, and other adverbs
- **RULE 30**: Double negatives
- **RULE 31**: Prepositions govern the objective case
- **RULE 32**: Nouns signifying distance/time governed by an understood preposition
- **RULE 33**: Conjunctions connect nouns and pronouns in the same case
- **RULE 34**: Conjunctions connect verbs of like moods and tenses
- **RULE 35**: Case of nouns/pronouns following "than", "as", or "but"

#### Orthography Rules (Spelling)
- **ORTHO I**: Monosyllables ending in f, l, or s - double final consonant
- **ORTHO II**: Polysyllables ending in f, l, or s - accent-based doubling

- **ORTHO VI**: Final silent e - drop before vowel-initial suffix
- **ORTHO VII-IX**: Additional derivative/spelling cases
- **ORTHO X**: Adding -ing or -ish - drop final e

#### Punctuation Rules
- **COMMA 1-10**: Comprehensive comma usage rules

## üìñ Usage Examples

### Basic Parsing

```python
from kirkham import KirkhamParser

parser = KirkhamParser()
result = parser.parse("The cat sat on the mat.")

# Access components
print(f"Subject: {result.subject.text}")  # "The cat"
print(f"Verb: {result.verb_phrase.text}")  # "sat"
print(f"Voice: {result.voice.value}")  # "neuter"
```

### Orthography and Punctuation Validation

```python
from kirkham import KirkhamParser

parser = KirkhamParser()

# Orthography validation (spelling)
result = parser.parse("I am happi.")
print("Spelling flags:", [f.message for f in result.flags if 'ORTHO' in f.rule.value])
# Output: ['Word ending in y after consonant should change y to i before termination']

# Punctuation validation
result = parser.parse("Hello world")  # Missing period
print("Punctuation flags:", [f.message for f in result.flags if 'PERIOD' in f.rule.value])
# Output: ['Sentence should end with period, exclamation, or question mark']

# Proper nouns are correctly ignored
result = parser.parse("Lagos is a city in Nigeria.")
print("Orthography flags:", [f.message for f in result.flags if 'ORTHO' in f.rule.value])
# Output: [] (no flags - proper nouns ignored)
```

### Configuration

```python
from kirkham import KirkhamParser, ParserConfig

# Custom configuration
config = ParserConfig(
    # Traditional grammar rules
    enforce_rule_20_strict=False,  # Allow transitive verbs without objects
    allow_informal_pronouns=True,  # Allow "It's me"
    enable_extended_validation=True,  # Enable additional checks

    # Orthography (spelling) rules
    enforce_ortho_rules=True,  # Enable orthography checking
    enforce_ortho_i=True,  # Monosyllables ending in f/l/s
    enforce_ortho_ii=True,  # Polysyllables ending in f/l/s
    enforce_ortho_iii=True,  # Words ending in y after consonant

    # Punctuation rules
    enforce_punctuation_rules=True,  # Enable punctuation checking
    enforce_comma_rules=True,  # Enable comma rules
    enforce_period_rules=True,  # Enable period rules

)

parser = KirkhamParser(config)
```

### Batch Processing

```python
# Parse multiple sentences
sentences = [
    "The cat sat on the mat.",
    "She writes beautiful poems.",
    "The birds are singing."
]

results = parser.parse_batch(sentences)

# Process results
for i, result in enumerate(results):
    print(f"Sentence {i+1}: {result.subject.text if result.subject else 'No subject'}")
```

### File Processing

```python
# Parse from file
results = parser.parse_file("sentences.txt", sentence_per_line=True)

# Parse with auto-sentence splitting
results = parser.parse_file("document.txt", sentence_per_line=False)
```

### Custom Lexicons

```python
from kirkham import KirkhamParser, Lexicon

# Create custom lexicon
custom_lexicon = Lexicon(
    transitive_verbs={"customize", "extend", "modify"},
    common_nouns={"widget", "gadget", "device"}
)

parser = KirkhamParser(lexicon=custom_lexicon)
```

### Output Formats

```python
# JSON output
json_data = parser.to_json("The cat sat on the mat.")

# Human-readable explanation
explanation = parser.explain("The cat sat on the mat.")

# CONLL format
conll_output = parser._formatter.to_conll(result)

# Penn Treebank format
treebank_output = parser._formatter.to_penn_treebank(result)

# Graphviz visualization
graphviz_output = parser._formatter.to_graphviz(result)
```
